# A few reflections on completing another Journey around the Sun. 

1. Life is genuienly shorter than you realize. 

"*It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it.*" - Seneca On the Shortness of Life

Try to relentless prune as much bullshit as possible. Overtime I have realised that wasting time on social media, associating yourself with more labels especially with politics & religion as paul graham said [Keep your Identity Small](https://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html) , wasting your time with (never ever let anyone drain your energy) & waiting for the wrong people (your heart will feel this), wasting time in the endless meetings & many more. I guess it's sad people only realise the value of time as they grow older but I have been lucky enough to have to have realised this at a young age. 

Treat time as one of your most valuable assests & not many people realise this in their pursuit of materialistic success. Say No if you have to make time for youself & your loved one's & also be okay with people telling you No. 

A few blogs from people I love on the Shortness of Life:

- [Life is Short](https://paulgraham.com/vb.html) - Paul Graham

2. There are a few things In life you will only learn the hard way & It's okay. I wish everyone goes through a bad phase In their life only to realise how beautiful life is. 

"*Greatness is not intelligence. Greatness comes from character. And character isn’t formed out of smart people, it’s formed out of people who suffered* - Jensen Huang"

Don't get me wrong on this I have personally seen & have experianced this myself. We live in era of abundance comfort & little period of suffering can do a world of good.

3. Health is your one & only most Important true asset

It's very simple, the world has made this very complicated. Just get good sleep , eat clean food & exercise. More importantly have meaningful relationships with people. 

4. Happiness is choice that you can make every sigle day 

I heard the best thing you can do is try to be in a good mood. Figure out what does happiness really mean to you

5. Have a purpose , Have strong Why's & Have ambitious goals. 

The reason to have these is not because of the outcome but because of who you become as a person in this process. 

"*Set a goal that'll make you stretch that far.
For what it'll make of you to achieve it.*"

"*The greatest value in life is not what you get,
the greatest value in life is what you become.*"  - Jim Rohn

Ambitious goals does not only mean to make billions of dollars of money but It can be as simple as learning a difficult language , climbing that moutain, running an ultramarathon. Have something to look forward to. 


6. Money does really matter and It can buy happiness If you know how to use It the right way. 

7. Strive & Work hard to have the right people around you.

8. Read more books. 

It's magical , It's beatiful , It's the best gift humanity has given to each other. 

9. Travel as much as possible. 

Travel to have fun , Travel for the curiosity , Travel for the adventure , Travel for the learning - Just keep travelling. 

10. Materriasltic stuff does not really matter but you will most likely realise this when you have It. So I wish you to have this sooner 

11. Let curisoity to drive you to places you have never been to and have a mindset of a beginner. Do not let yourself into the trap of expertise. 

12. Understanding the universe Is also deeply knowing who you are as a person. 

It teaches you humility & as Carl Sagan said It is truly an humbling & character building experience. 

We humans took a lot of pride that the earth is the center of the universe only to realise it isn't. We then took pride in the fact we are the only planet just to realise we have neighbours, we took pride that okay maybe our sun is the only star and it's the center of the universe only to realise there are billions of stars. we took pride in that our solar system is in the center of the galxy only to realise that we are 26000 light years away from the center of the galaxy. we took pride in the fact milky way is the only galaxy only to realise that every single dot that you seen in the below Image is a galaxy with billions of stars & planets. ~ Humility
