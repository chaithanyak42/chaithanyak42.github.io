I think there's something magical & a sense of feeling of huge accomplishment when you do hard things. I am not able to express It through words but every time when I do a hard thing I feel that I can do anything In my life, I get a feeling where I can just get done a piece of work which I thought I could not do It earlier. It's like when you do a certain hard thing, It has a great level of positive net impact on other areas of your life at-least to certain degree for sure.

Also this only happens when you have done enough hard things consistently over certain period of time, does not mean months, years or decades - you get that sense of feeling 3-4 weeks when you are Into that thing and It does compound.

One hard thing that I have been doing consistently (as of my writing It's been 3 weeks) is showing up at the gym at 5:30 every single morning or running. The society has always been told us to be normal - do good at your studies, get a job, get married, make babies, take a much less riskier path, do things that everyone else has been doing, make a lot of money, retire and finally die.

Jeff Bezos In his last Amazon shareholder letter wrote something like this:

> "In what ways does the world pull at you in an attempt to make you normal? How much work does it take to maintain your distinctiveness?...You have to pay a price for your distinctiveness...don't expect it to be easy or free"

You can see this all around you and I have experienced this enough in 26 years of my life so far.

The only thing you can do to break this cycle and be uniquely distinct from others by doing hard things - do things that feels like work to you and when other people see you they think you are fool, weird or whatever the hell they might think - that's what you are looking at.

I'm writing this as a reminder to myself so I can do enough hard things, endure enough suffering & pain deliberately. It builds resilience and more importantly It builds a strong mental strength.

So whatever It is that you are after my friend - just go do It. Ignore the outside world, listen to your inner self and get the fucking work done.
