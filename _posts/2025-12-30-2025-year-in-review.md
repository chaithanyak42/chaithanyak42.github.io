## A Familiar Pattern, Yet Something Different

2025 has been a peculiar year for me like all the previous years have been. Most years begin with promises to myself with strong intentions I genuinely believe In but more often than not I tend to fail to follow through on many of them.

But in 2025, I feel grateful for everything that has happened, and it’s one of those years where, when I truly look back and reflect, I feel that I have grown up a lot as an individual in every aspect of my life be it the work that I’ve done, my health, financially, or even in finding love. I feel genuinely satisfied 🙂

### Reflecting on a few things 

#### Health 

At the start of the year, I promised myself that I would become an endurance athlete and run a few marathons (haha, I told myself I’d run ultramarathons). What was I even thinking?? (I will keep doing this until it becomes a reality 🙂). Yet, I still feel very happy about the amount of stuff that I have learnt about health in general, and more importantly, implementing them on a regular basis.

Also Somewhere in between, I ended up running an 8K in the rain :) 

It’s very simple (things are way too complicated in the outside world).

- First things first, please get health insurance (just stop everything that you are doing right now and get this done for yourself and your family).
- Make it a habit of getting a regular health check-up done. It’s way better to know what’s happening with your body than not knowing at all. I keep track of every metric and get my health check-up done once every six months to track progress.
- Health is very simple
  - Eat clean food (optimise for a protein-rich diet) and reduce any kind of junk.
  - Good sleep 
  - Get enough daily movement 

- Overall, I had more days with better sleep, I ran and moved more than I did in 2024, and I'm also really happy about probably the most important of them all nutrition.

Ended up doing lots of morning runs in Cubbon Park and Lal Bagh.

####  Work 

I am glad that I ended up sticking to AI right from the day I realised I love physics and math. There’s never been a better time to be in this space, and I am happy that in 2025 I was able to work on a wide range of problems such as:

- Trend forecasting (simply put, leveraging AI to help fashion brands figure out the latest trends at scale)
- I joined a very early stage startup as one of the founding engineers and worked on building agents from the ground up in a language I had never coded in before. Learnt a lot here about:
  - Shipping speed matters
  - Realised that getting the abstractions right is far more important to scale a product smoothly
- Did a bit of consulting for multiple US tech startups, working on problems such as:
  - Learnt a lot about evals
  - Did tonnes of vibecoding and tried every new tool out there, but stuck with Claude Code as my favourite vibecoding tool
- Joined another startup and am currently working on something that I’ve always wanted to deeply understand, which is memory

I never really planned any of these things at the start of 2025, but I am glad about how things have panned out and the amount of stuff that I was able to learn in 2025.

#### People & Travel 

One thing that I'm really happy about in 2025 is the number of really amazing people that I have met, especially random strangers that I happened to meet online (largely via work and Twitter).

I ended up learning something from each and every one of them, and also made a few lifelong friends. I'm yet to meet a few of them in person.

2025 also saw my best friend getting married. I was absolutely happy for him, and it’s one of those very few friendships that has lasted more than a decade. I cannot wait to keep trucking with him.

I also went on a couple of dates after a long time. I fucked it up but At the same time, I'm really happy that I met this one wonderful human at the fag end of the year, and so far, I’m happy about how things are going between us. Hopefully, things work out. I also ended up doing certain things that I never imagined I would be doing myself in 2025, and one of those things was dancing.

2025 was one of those years where I had to break my cycle of doing at least one high altitude trek a year, which I had been doing for the last three years.

I could not make time for it, as I ended up getting a lot of really amazing opportunities that I could not pass up. I did take some time off, though. I ended up travelling with my family. I also took an international trip to Singapore, which was really, really amazing.

2025, to me, has been a year of so many surprises, and it turned out to be a year where I grew a lot as a better human, more grounded in the values that I always promised myself.

I still wasn’t able to do a lot of things that I intended to do, but that’s something I would very much like to change in 2026.

#### Quitting the Job

2025 was also a year of lots of uncertainty.

My learning at one of the first few startups that I joined had already stagnated, and after that, in early March, I ended up joining another startup as one of the founding engineers. I did get to work with some really good minds, but my heart was always into research. I wanted to work more on applied AI research and slowly move into more fundamental research.

Midway through the year, even though I was doing really well in my job, I ended up taking probably one of the most difficult decisions of my life: I quit my job without having any clarity on what I wanted to do in the future.

Luckily, the two to three weeks of not having any job or responsibility helped me reflect a lot on what I really wanted to do. I had plans of starting something on my own, but I wasn’t really confident. There was a lot of uncertainty. Money was a big factor, and I constantly questioned myself: “Did I really make a good decision quitting my job at that point in time?”

But when I look back, I don’t think I regret that decision.

A lot of really amazing things happened after that. I ended up meeting some really good people, got a lot of consulting gigs in the AI space, and finally landed a remote job where I started earning in dollars and, more importantly, doing work that I’m really proud of.


> I think at some point in life, you reach a stage where you feel it’s time to take control of your life rather than just going with the flow. Even if great things are happening, I feel that 2026 is genuinely going to be the year where I focus more on agency, take control of my life, and shape it the way I want to. I’m very confident that I’ll be able to do this.

> Most importantly, I keep asking myself this question now: “How does my life look if I had 10× more agency than what I have today?”


#### Looking Ahead to 2026

A few things I am looking forward to In 2026

- Run a few marathons and really work this time towards becoming an endurance athlete
- Work on fundamental research and get closer to learning physics and math deeply
- Hike mountains more (missed out in 2025) and travel Europe
- Embrace serendipity just like in 2025, and hopefully with a lot of surprises
