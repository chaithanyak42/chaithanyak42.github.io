I'm a machine learning researcher and engineer focused on building AI systems that solve real-world problems. Currently leading ML development at [Stylumia](https://www.stylumia.ai/), where I work on multimodal LLMs for fashion trend recommendations.

> *"Spend 10,000 hours on deliberate effort and work, form a daily habit, and compare yourself to yourself from a year ago to track progress."* - Andrej Karpathy

## Current Work
Building scalable AI systems for fashion trend analysis and demand forecasting at Stylumia. Previously worked as an ML research fellow at [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/) on pre-launch demand estimation research.

## Interests & Learning
My time is dedicated to:
- Building AI models for real-world applications
- Reading Paul Graham's [Essays](https://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html)
- Studying The Feynman Lectures on [Physics](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/)
- Following [Karpathy's](https://karpathy.ai/) lessons on AI

I believe in doing what you [Love](https://paulgraham.com/love.html), pursuing [Great Work](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html), and embracing [Hard Work](https://paulgraham.com/hwh.html).

When not coding, you'll find me trekking, exploring nature, or diving into books about the human brain.
