Hi Everyone. I'm Chaithanya, I'm a coder and a writer. 

Everyday I'm taking small steps towards figuring out How To Do What You [Love](https://paulgraham.com/love.html) , How To Do [Great Work](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html) & How To Do [Hard Work](https://paulgraham.com/hwh.html) 

Most of my productive time is spent learning about the stuff that helps me build AI models to solve real-world use cases & almost all my spare time goes into reading Paul Graham's [Essays](https://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html), The Feynman Lectures on [Physics](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/) & [Karpathy's](https://karpathy.ai/) lessons on AI :)

All I'm trying to do Is follow Andrej Karpathy's wise words **"Spend 10,000 hours on deliberate effort and work, form a daily habit, and compare yourself to yourself from a year ago to track progress."** So If you're someone Like that - Hit me up , Let's grab a cup of coffee & see what you're upto. 

I'm currently at a fashion tech startup [Stylumia](https://www.stylumia.ai/), leading their e2e (Product & ML) development of Fashion Trend Recommendation by leveraging LLMs (Multimodal) at scale on millions of fashion Images. Occasionally I also work on problems related to time series forecasting & operations research.  

I was also working as an ML research fellow remotely at [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/) focusing on Pre-launch Demand Estimation and Optimal Product Diversity. But could not dedicate enough time to It & had to drop off :(

I love trekking and mountaineering, traveling, learning about the intricacies of the human brain, running, and taking long, aimless walks in nature.
