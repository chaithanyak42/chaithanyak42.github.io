Hi Everyone. I'm Chaithanya, a writer and Data Scientist. I was born to a lower-middle-class family in a small village in India, I was the first in my family to get any kind of formal education. Most of my productive time is spent learning about stuff that helps build AI models to solve real-world use cases & almost all my spare time goes into reading Paul Graham's [Essays](https://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html), The Feynman Lectures on [Physics](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/) & [Karpathy's](https://karpathy.ai/) lessons on AI :)

I actively maintain a document [Stuff That Helped Me Along The Way](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xo7k-mhKVoM1ku_uY1qpFGEMX98QJTObmtiu--Gs6Zk/edit?usp=sharing) & I'm just trying to follow Andrej Karpathy's wise words **"Spend 10,000 hours on deliberate effort and work, form a daily habit, and compare yourself to yourself from a year ago to track progress."**

I'm currently at [Stylumia](https://www.stylumia.ai/), leading the e2e (Product & ML) development of Fashion Trend Recommendation by leveraging LLMs (Multimodal) at scale on millions of fashion Images. Occasionally I also work on problems related to time series forecasting & optimisation. I'm also working as a ML research fellow remotely at [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/) focusing on Pre-launch Demand Estimation and Optimal Product Diversity.

I love trekking and mountaineering, traveling, learning about the intricacies of the human brain, running, and taking long, aimless walks in nature.
