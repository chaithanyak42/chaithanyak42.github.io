Hello fellow earthlings and aliens! Welcome to my corner of the universe. How lucky for us to meet here on a rocky planet,a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

I'm a machine learning researcher and engineer focused on building AI systems that solve real-world problems. Currently, I'm working at [mem0](https://mem0.ai/) as a member of technical staff primarily working on the memory layer. I previously worked at Upsurge Labs for about three months as one of the founding AI engineers where I had a chance to be one of the first people to build & shape [bhindi.io](https://bhindi.io/). I have previously led the ML development at [Stylumia](https://www.stylumia.ai/) where I worked on multimodal LLMs for fashion trend recommendations and other wide range of problems over a span of four years.

## What I'm Doing Now

*Updated on July 31, 2024, from my home in Bengaluru.*

**Work:** Currently working at mem0 as a research engineer, contributing my part towards improving memory. I've always been obsessed with how the human brain works, and one of the most important parts of the human brain is memory.

**Running:** Recently obsessed with running and working towards becoming an ultra-marathon runner. I have my first ever marathon coming up - the TCS Amsterdam Marathon happening on October 19th. You can follow my journey on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/125663266).

**Health:** Obsessed with health and longevity, particularly fascinated by questions like: Why do we age and can aging be reversed? While I believe in Steve Jobs' wisdom that "death is the greatest invention of life" and gives meaning to our existence, I have strong reasons for wanting to live long enough to:
1. See fellow humans become a spacefaring civilization and reach Mars - there's so much to learn yet so little time, which drives my interest in physics and understanding how the world works
2. Spend time learning about the universe and its mysteries
3. Travel and hike as many mountains as possible

**Adventure:** Love to travel, but more importantly, I'm passionate about hiking and mountaineering. Currently preparing for a solo hike on the [Arctic Circle Trail](https://arcticcircletrail.gl/) in Greenland.

## Interests & Learning
My time is dedicated to:
- Building AI models for real-world applications
- Reading Paul Graham's [Essays](https://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html)
- Studying The Feynman Lectures on [Physics](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/)
- Following [Karpathy's](https://karpathy.ai/) lessons on AI

I believe in doing what you [Love](https://paulgraham.com/love.html), pursuing [Great Work](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html), and embracing [Hard Work](https://paulgraham.com/hwh.html).

When not coding, you'll find me trekking, running , exploring nature, or diving into books about the human brain.
